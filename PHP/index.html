    <h1> Welcome to PHP.</h1>
    <p> So, if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the include file is missing, use the include statement. Otherwise, in case of FrameWork, CMS, or a complex PHP application coding, always use the require statement to include a key file to the flow of execution. This will help avoid compromising your applications
        security and integrity, just in-case one key file is accidentally missing. </p>
